/**
 * Load plugins from the given specifiers, register them, then run setup().
 *
 * Node: specifiers are npm package names (e.g. "matbot-anthropic") or
 *   file paths relative to the process working directory.
 *
 * Browser: specifiers must be URL paths served from the same origin
 *   (e.g. "/plugins/matbot-anthropic.js" or "./plugins/my-plugin.js").
 *   Bare package names are supported only if an import map is in scope.
 *   A failed import logs a warning and is skipped rather than aborting
 *   startup — the browser has no node_modules to fall back to.
 *
 * Each module must export either:
 *   export const plugin: MatbotPlugin  (named export, preferred)
 *   export default { plugin: MatbotPlugin }  (default export)
 *
 * A specifier is normally a string that is both imported and recorded as the plugin's
 * `specifier`. The object form decouples those concerns for a host that has already done its
 * own resolution:
 *   - `spec` — recorded as the plugin's `specifier` (the human/config-level identity).
 *   - `importSpec` — the URL actually imported, when it differs from `spec`. The browser
 *     fetches a remote plugin, type-strips it, and imports the resulting ephemeral `blob:`
 *     URL while recording the original source URL as `spec`; node imports a resolved
 *     `file://` path while recording the original `matbot.yaml` entry. Defaults to `spec`.
 *     `bustCache` still applies to a pre-set `importSpec`: a `file:` URL is stamped in place
 *     (the host owns resolution — re-resolving `spec` here would fail for `./…`-relative or
 *     remote specifiers — but the loader owns the freshness stamp). A `blob:` URL is left
 *     untouched (a `?${FRESH_PARAM}` query does not resolve to the blob, and the browser busts
 *     by reloading the whole realm anyway); any other scheme is passed through unstamped.
 *   - `name` — the canonical plugin name, when the host has already derived it (e.g. by
 *     reading the resolved package.json). Bypasses `resolver.identify(spec)` — necessary
 *     because `spec` (a remote URL, a versioned npm range) may not itself identify the name.
 *   - `runtimes` — the package.json `matbotRuntime`, when the host has already read it; used
 *     for the pre-import gate in place of `resolver.runtimes(spec)`.
 *
 * @param bustCache When true, the URL imported for each specifier gets a unique
 *   `${FRESH_PARAM}` query stamp appended before importing — either a host-pre-resolved
 *   `file:` `importSpec` stamped in place, or, absent one, the bare `spec` resolved via
 *   `import.meta.resolve` and then stamped. This forces the JS engine to bypass its module
 *   cache and re-evaluate the entry from disk. With the companion node resolve hook installed
 *   (apps/cli/ts-hooks.js) the stamp propagates to the plugin's first-party imports too, so the
 *   entire subtree re-evaluates — necessary when reloading a plugin whose code, or whose own
 *   modules' code, changed since startup. When resolution is needed but `import.meta.resolve`
 *   is unavailable (or throws), it falls back to the original specifier — re-importing the
 *   cached module — and logs a warning. (Because the single-funnel node host always supplies a
 *   pre-resolved `importSpec`, forgetting to stamp it silently neuters every node reload —
 *   hence the stamp is applied here, in the loader, not left to the caller.)
 * @param prompt Optional host prompt used by setup() to resolve tool-name collisions
 *   interactively. Omitted by non-interactive hosts, in which case collisions overwrite
 *   silently (the historical default).
 * @param onLoadError What to do when an entry cannot become a plugin — an incompatible
 *   `matbotRuntime`, an import that rejects, or a module that is not plugin-shaped (no `plugin`
 *   export, no `apiVersion`, a non-function lifecycle member). `'skip'` (default, the startup
 *   batch) warns and moves on — one mis-targeted or non-plugin entry in the config must not abort
 *   the process, or, under a supervisor that restarts on exit (systemd `Restart=always`), a single
 *   bad `matbot.yaml` line becomes an unbreakable crash loop fixable only by hand-editing the
 *   config. `'throw'` is for an explicit, single, user-initiated load (the `plugin`/`provider`
 *   tools via `services.loadPlugin`): the user named *this* plugin, so a silent skip would surface
 *   only as a confusing empty-result error downstream — fail loudly with the reason instead.
