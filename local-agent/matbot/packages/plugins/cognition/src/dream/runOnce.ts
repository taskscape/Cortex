/**
 * The dream-time pipeline: the deterministic spine of one consolidation pass.
 *
 * `runOnce` is pure procedure. Every irreducibly-judgemental step is delegated through one of two
 * narrow interfaces — {@link Ranker} for scoring (fact, skill) pairs, {@link Merger} for editing
 * prose. Everything else — fetching facts, filtering out already-processed ones, picking the
 * oldest, building the candidate set, applying the blocklist, thresholding scores into routing
 * decisions, identifying cluster-mates, looping the merger over the cluster, CAS-writing facts
 * back, assembling and persisting the {@link DreamRun} record — is here, in TypeScript, in one
 * readable function.
 *
 * The point of this layout is observability and replaceability. The pipeline can be reasoned
 * about, traced, and tested without ever calling an LLM (pass in stub Ranker/Merger). The Ranker
 * can be swapped for an embedding implementation, a small classifier, or anything else without
 * touching this file.
 *
 * `runOnce` itself is a single async function rather than a class because there is no per-call
 * state worth carrying across calls. Cross-call concerns (the process-local mutex that serialises
 * runs, the wiring of stores, the choice of Ranker/Merger implementation) live in the caller —
 * `./service.ts` when added, or the tool executor when added — not here.
