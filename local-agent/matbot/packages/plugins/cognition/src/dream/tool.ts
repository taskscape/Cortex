/**
 * The `dream_time` tool: one pass of background memory consolidation, exposed to the model.
 *
 * Zero-input tool. Everything it needs is already in `MatbotMachine` (the skill manager, the
 * stores, the provider list) and `ToolContext` (the active provider, the abort signal). Returns a
 * single result event carrying the fully-assembled {@link DreamRun} record; the same record is
 * also persisted to the `dream_runs` store, so observability survives the conversation that
 * triggered it.
 *
 * The deterministic spine lives in `./runOnce.ts`. This file is the thin tool-shaped wrapper:
 *
 *   • A process-local mutex serialises runs. Two `dream_time` calls in flight at once is a
 *     hazard (they would race on `SkillManager.save` and on per-fact CAS writes), and there is no
 *     legitimate reason to run them in parallel — one consolidation pass at a time is the design.
 *
 *   • The ranker and merger each resolve their own provider independently — `dreamRankerProvider`
 *     / `dreamMergerProvider` (cognition_config) if pinned, else `ctx.provider` (the model driving
 *     the calling turn). Unpinned, a user on a cheap model gets cheap dream-time and a user on a
 *     thinky model gets thinky dream-time — no config needed to get started. Pinning matters most
 *     for the merger: it sees a whole skill's prose plus the fact, so a small-context provider can
 *     truncate and fail on a large skill even when the same provider ranks fine (ranking only ever
 *     sees short summaries, never full skill prose).
 *
 *   • The DreamRun is persisted BEFORE being returned. If the persist fails, the caller still
 *     sees the result; if the caller is aborted before reading the result, the run is still
 *     recorded. Belt and braces, because the cost of a missing run record is "we can't reason
 *     about why dream-time did what it did", which is exactly what this whole exercise was for.
