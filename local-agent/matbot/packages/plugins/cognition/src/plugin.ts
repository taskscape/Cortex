/**
 * Cognitive services. It seeds the Inner voice skill and dream_time tool into the active skills service,
 * registers the remember_fact and dream_time tools, and wires remember_fact's trigger; it is the
 * intended home for further cognitive skills and tools.
 *
 * It does not set skills up itself — it is a *consumer* of the skills capability, not a
 * specialization of it — so it discovers the live {@link SkillManager} off the registry rather than
 * taking a runtime dependency on a specific provider. Any skills provider satisfies it
 * (@matatbread/matbot-skills, …-node, a future backend).
 *
 * Absence of a skills service is handled gracefully rather than fatally: seeding needs the live
 * manager, which a registry consumer can't guarantee is present at its own setup (config/load order
 * is not ours to dictate). So it subscribes to the SkillManager mount via `services.mounted` with
 * `replay: true` — `seedCognition` runs once now if a manager is already present, and again on each
 * (re)mount if a skills provider is loaded later. Seeding is idempotent (`importIfAbsent`), so a
 * remount re-seed is a no-op. This makes seeding order-independent and self-healing with no resident
 * per-turn hook and no reload.
 *
 * The inner-voice provider is likewise not required: the Inner voice skill calls cognition's own
 * `ask_inner_voice` tool, which falls back to the current turn's model when none is pinned via
 * `cognition_config` (a same-lineage self-critique — degraded, but it still fires).

service — if no skills service is configured yet, they are seeded automatically once one is — and
registers the remember_fact and dream_time tools.

The **Inner voice skill** consults a second model via the \`ask_inner_voice\` tool. ${await innerVoiceStatus(captured)}

The **\`remember_fact\` tool** captures user-provided facts, personal details, and preferences worth
remembering across conversations. It is fired by a trigger (the conditions of the former "Remember this"
skill) and runs as a silent side-effect: it reads the latest user message and its provenance from
context, makes one LLM call to extract and normalise the fact(s), and writes each to the
remembered_facts store — no extra conversation turns. The model is not woken. (Needs the triggers
plugin for its trigger; the trigger's conditions are judged by the triggers classifier — pin which
provider via the triggers_config tool, else it uses the turn's own provider.)

The **\`dream_time\` tool** runs one pass of background memory consolidation. It is a deterministic
TypeScript pipeline: it picks the oldest unassigned fact from the remembered_facts store, scores it against
every existing skill via two narrow LLM judgement calls (rank and merge — each pinned independently via
cognition_config, else falling back to the active turn's provider), and — if a skill clears the configured
threshold — splices the fact in and marks it processed (a \`dreamSkill\` field). A fact that scores too low
("none") gets one extra look enriched with conversation context before being retired; a fact that scores
only weakly is deferred rather than retired, since a future pass against a changed skill set may answer
differently; a merge that fails outright quarantines the fact rather than retrying indefinitely. Each pass
writes a structured \`DreamRun\` record to the \`dream_runs\` store. Intended to be invoked via the
\`background\` tool on a schedule, never inline. One pass at a time is enforced by a process-local mutex.

It also seeds a remembered_facts store and its \`remembered_facts_action\` tool, written to by remember_fact.
The store is idempotent: a re-seed on restart keeps the existing data.
