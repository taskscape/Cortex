/**
 * A trigger is a data-driven hook: a set of natural-language conditions and the single tool call to
 * make when any of them is judged to match. The conditions are the OR — many ways to recognise the
 * situation — and `invoke` is the one consequence. There is no skill coupling: a trigger names a
 * tool, not a skill, so firing a skill is just `invoke: skill_action({ action: 'use', … })` like
 * any other tool call (`use` applies the skill as a directive; `load` returns raw content, which is
 * for reading/editing, not firing). What the model sees afterwards is decided observationally — see dispatch.ts.
 */

/**
 * What a trigger does when one of its conditions matches. A single discriminator: it fixes the
 * surface judged, the hook, AND how the fired tool's output reaches the model — because those are
 * not independent (delivery determines surface). The four are disjoint and exhaustive, two per
 * surface:
 *
 *  `ephemeral`  — judge the USER message (pre-response `screen` hook); run the tool and inject its
 *    output for THIS turn only — never persisted, byte-stable prefix preserved. The one-shot "route
 *    knowledge in for this answer" case (was named `augment`).
 *  `contextual` — judge the USER message (pre-response `screen` hook); run the tool and fold its
 *    output DURABLY onto the user turn (an `origin: 'robo'` block, persisted + visible), so it
 *    updates the conversation rather than informing one answer. Use when a match means "this should
 *    become part of the session", not "correct just this turn". The durable twin of `ephemeral`.
 *  `retract`    — judge the ASSISTANT response (post-commit `followup` hook); the response is treated
 *    as WRONG — pop it into a retraction marker and re-run the user turn with the output injected, so
 *    the bad answer does NOT remain (e.g. "the field is `pgdwell`, not `dwell`": everything built on
 *    the wrong field is void, so regenerate from scratch with the correction).
 *  `followup`   — judge the ASSISTANT response (post-commit `followup` hook); the response STANDS but
 *    warrants a steer or verification — keep it and resubmit the output as a robo turn, so the
 *    response stays in context for the steer to make sense (Inner Voice / Verify Assumptions /
 *    Bicameral — critiques *of* the standing answer, meaningless without it).
 *
 * The author picks the kind because only they know whether a match means "read this for now" /
 * "remember this from now on" / "this is wrong" / "look again".
